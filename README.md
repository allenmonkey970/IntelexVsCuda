# IntelexVsCuda

## Overview
This project aims to benchmark and compare the performance of different machine 
learning models using Intel's scikit-learn-intellex and NVIDIA's CUDA-accelerated XGBoost across various datasets. The goal is to determine which optimization provides better performance for specific machine learning tasks
for my college research.
### Setup
**Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   conda install scikit-learn
   conda install -c conda-forge cupy
   conda install -c conda-forge py-xgboost-gpu
   conda install scikit-learn-intelex 
   ```
This should install on dependencies if not install pandas, warning, and numpy.

## Results
Will add later
